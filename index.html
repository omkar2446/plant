            <p>Plantation is the process of planting trees and other vegetation to improve the environment and promote
                sustainability. It plays a vital role in reducing air pollution, preventing soil erosion, conserving
                water, enhancing biodiversity, and combating climate change. By planting trees in areas like schools,
                roadsides, parks, and degraded lands, communities can improve air quality, support wildlife, and
                maintain ecological balance. Native and fast-growing trees such as neem, peepal, bamboo, and gulmohar
                are often chosen for their environmental benefits. Plantation activities not only beautify surroundings
                but also raise awareness about environmental protection and encourage collective responsibility for a
                greener future.</p>

            <h2>soil protection</h2>
            <img src="so1.jpeg">
            <img src="so2.jpeg">
            <img src="so3.jpeg">
            <img src="so4.jpeg">
            <p>Soil protection refers to the conservation and management of soil to prevent its degradation and ensure
                its long-term health and fertility. Healthy soil is essential for agriculture, plant growth, water
                filtration, and supporting biodiversity. However, soil faces threats such as erosion, overuse of
                chemical fertilizers, deforestation, and pollution. Protecting soil involves practices like
                afforestation, using organic compost, crop rotation, mulching, building check dams, and avoiding
                overgrazing. These methods help retain nutrients, prevent erosion, and maintain the natural balance of
                the soil. By protecting soil, we safeguard food security, support ecosystems, and contribute to a more
                sustainable and resilient environment.</p>
            <h2>soil testing</h2>
            <img src="te1.jpeg">
            <img src="te2.jpeg">
            <img src="te3.jpeg">
            <img src="te4.jpeg">
            <p>Soil testing is the process of analyzing soil samples to determine their nutrient content, pH level,
                moisture, and other characteristics important for plant growth. It helps farmers and gardeners
                understand the health and fertility of the soil, allowing them to make informed decisions about which
                crops to grow and what type of fertilizers or treatments are needed. Soil testing can detect
                deficiencies in nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and also identify problems such as
                soil acidity or salinity. Regular soil testing improves crop yield, prevents overuse of chemicals, and
                promotes sustainable farming by maintaining soil quality and reducing environmental harm</p>
            <h2>Natural fertilizers</h2>
            <img src="NA1.jpeg">
            <img src="NA2.jpeg">
            <img src="NA3.jpeg">
            <img src="NA4.jpeg">
            <P>Natural fertilizers, also known as organic fertilizers, are substances made from natural sources that
                provide essential nutrients to plants and improve soil health without harming the environment. Common
                examples include compost, cow dung, green manure, bone meal, neem cake, and vermicompost. These
                fertilizers release nutrients slowly, enrich the soil with organic matter, and support beneficial
                microorganisms. Unlike chemical fertilizers, natural fertilizers do not cause pollution or damage soil
                structure. They help retain moisture, improve soil fertility, and promote sustainable farming practices.
                Using natural fertilizers is a safe and eco-friendly way to grow healthy crops while protecting the
                environment.</P>
            <h2>Effect of chemical fertilizers</h2>
            <img src="ce1.jpeg">
            <img src="ce2.jpeg">
            <img src="ce3.jpeg">
            <img src="ce4.jpeg">
            <p>Chemical fertilizers are synthetic substances used to supply nutrients to crops, but their excessive or
                improper use can have several harmful effects on the environment and human health. Over time, they can
                degrade soil quality by reducing natural fertility and killing beneficial microorganisms. Chemical
                fertilizers often lead to soil acidity, water pollution (due to runoff into rivers and lakes), and
                groundwater contamination, which harms aquatic life and makes water unsafe for drinking. They also
                contribute to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. In humans, exposure to contaminated food or
                water can lead to serious health issues. Therefore, while chemical fertilizers can boost crop yields
                temporarily, their long-term use can damage ecosystems and reduce sustainable agricultural productivity.
